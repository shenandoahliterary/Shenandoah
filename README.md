# **Website Updates To Think About and/or Execute**

These items are submitted by Beth.

## **Navigation**

*   [ ] Way to click through from piece to piece within issue
*   [ ] Way to navigate through pieces by subject or topic (see poetry.org)
*   [ ] Way to navigate from work to articles in The Peak and back
*   [ ] Way to to navigate between writers' multiple pieces (even across issues) \[examples on poetry.org\]
*   [ ] How to tell which issue (or date) a piece is from when you navigate right to it, i.e., direct link

## **Translations**

*   [ ] How to toggle/naviate between two versions?
*   [ ] Audio files added to translations

## **The Peak Changes**

*   [ ] Need image on article itself
*   [ ] Way to add co-author since these often will be conversations between two people
*   [ ] Need a way to navigate to specific categories: menu down the side?
*   [ ] Are the margins here bigger than the other pages?
*   [ ] Need a search option? Or a like this, you'll like that option?
*   [ ] Add in back articles and release new ones periodically in 202x

## **Design Stuff**

*   [ ] Use of color throughout. Does it change per issue? Where is it added as an accent?
*   [ ] Add pull quotes to stories and essays so that they break margins, see Ecotone.
*   [ ] Ending glyphs at close of essays and stories? ENDED here in adding to issues.

## **Newsletter**

*   [ ] Add way to capture email addresses at bottom of site, not just popup
*   [ ] Will newsletter be available on website?

## **Multimedia**

*   [ ] Podcast: Needs its own page or should have individual Peak article for each episode? Both? Podcasts are on Spotify and Apple Podcats.
*   [ ] A place to host videos or a YouTube channel? We now have multiple videos we've released on IG but are nowhere on website.
*   [ ] Link or embed to Spotify? We have a contributor playlist to promote.
*   [ ] Link or embed to Soundcloud for translation audio?

## **Fun Stuff**

*   [ ] Way to bookmark something to read later? Or share it?
*   [ ] Should there be a feed to our IG and/or Twitter feeds on website?
*   [ ] Add contributor bookshelf: notokensjournal.com

## **Small Stuff**

*   [ ] Ethos of Ice--can't see erasure options--move to under author name?
*   [ ] Contact us info somewhere?
*   [ ] Copyright info somewhere?
*   [ ] What to do about poems that need wider margins? Bio width becomes VERY wide then (se "Decoloinization Wiki")
*   [ ] Masthad pages need to be added for Beth's two first issues.

## Technical Matters

(per jeff)

*    [ ]  Link to other aticles/work of the author

Restructure submit page to make more accessible.Â 

*   [ ] add text boxes

Overall
