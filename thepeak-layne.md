As Coletta and Jeff work fastidiously on the technical side of this project, I've been thinking this week about what this might look like from the reader side. I've attached a mock up both square oriented gallery structure, and non-square oriented gallery structure, with category/subheading/title on each. On pages 2 and 3 of this document, I then mocked up what a series of these would look like on a page. Granted for the second option, the grander idea is that each size of the PNG would be different (not just squares and 5x7 rectangles), but hopefully this helps with visualization. 

On another note, here are the quick notes I took from last class on the navigation between texts WITHIN and issue, that I thought I would send over: "Creating a container on the side of an article/poem/piece of text that allows for the reader to click through without navigating back to the TOC or scrolling all the way down to the bottom. Could create a stylized tooltip so that the viewer knows what they are about to be reading (or who they are about to be reading). Reference Waxwing Mag. Will increase page views."

Finally, I have also been brainstorming "taglines" for The Peak, and while I'm sure they are all awful, I've included them below:

Shenandoah’s overlook into the worlds of our writers.
Shenandoah’s space for immediate creativity.
New words, earnest dialogue.
Constancy and sharp insights: Shenandoah’s The Peak. 
From the vantage point of our fixations: Shenandoah’s The Peak.
Shenandoah’s The Peak: Above the fray, a place for more.
